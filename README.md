## My process

I started with the HTML like always and then moved onto making it look like it should for mobile phones first. After that I made the desktop version of the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work with CSS grid more efficiently. I also learned that putting max-width on the cards might not be the best idea.
Had to use the developer tools quite a bit to figure out why my grid wasn't doing what it needed to be doing.

### Continued development

I will continue on improving my HTML and CSS skills alike, before I move onto working with JS.
I also need to work on making the designs look good on tablet devices since right now the mobile device design stretches until it reaches the desktop breakpoint.
